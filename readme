We construct a fast medicine identification system.

Run several .ipynb as follows:  

1.Collect medicine images, ex.10~30 pcs.
2.Run the Image_generate_ver2.ipynb, and change all root path.
  [notes: Sometimes you should run again to avoid the error occurred.]
3.Run the model.ipynb, and change all root path/medicine ID.  
  [notes: Remeber you need to check the .h5 file is generated.]
4.Run the medicine_project_ResNet, and change all root path/cam address.
